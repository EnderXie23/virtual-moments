You have to stay with us.
I feel like you're driving me to a court-martial.
Calm down.
This is crazy. What did I do?
You are alright sir.
I feel like you're going to pull over and snuff me.
Keep silence.
What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!
We can talk, sir.
Oh, I see. So it's personal?
No, you intimidate them.
Good God, you're a woman! I honestly... I couldn't have called that. I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.
I'm an airman.
You have, actually, excellent bone structure, there. I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh. Hey!
Sir, I have a question to ask.
Yes, please.
Is it true you went 12 for 12 with last year's Maxim cover models?
That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else? You're kidding me with the hand up, right?
Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
Yes. It's very cool.
All right.
I don't want to see this on your MySpace page. Please, no gang signs. No, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace.
Come on. Hurry up. Just click it. Don't change any settings. Just click it.
What's going on?
Contact left!
What have we got?
Stay down!
Yeah.Son of a bitch! Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
Stay here!
Whoa!
