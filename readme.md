# My Virtual Moments Repository
I have placed everything in the ipython notebook for now. Please make pull requests if you have got any good ideas.

I have implemented `extractor.py` to extract voice texts from online sources. You may find the python script useful if you want to extract certain files online. Remember to run the script under the main folder since the script uses **relative path**.

Congratulations! Now we can use a webui to chat with the LLM with character! (Yet the contents now is limited to Furina)
