# My Virtual Moments Repository
Now we have implemented the main functions of Virtual Moments.

The main entrance is at `webpage/VM.html`. To fully unlock the functions we have implemented, you shall run `webpage/webapi.py`, `webui/chatapi.py` and `webui/chatui.py` on the remote server. The three python scripts shall run simultaneously.

Congratulations! Now the HTML page can correctly call all the functions we have implemented.

Congratulations! Now we can use a webui to chat with the LLM with character! (Yet the contents now is limited to Furina)
