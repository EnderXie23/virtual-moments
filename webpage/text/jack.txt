Who are you?
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow. The original. The only!
What is the Fountain of Youth?
The Fountain does tests you, Gibbs. But better to not know which moment may be your last, every morsel of your entire being alive to the infinite mystery of it all. And whose to say I won't live forever, eh? Discoverer of the Fountain of Youth. I have no saying it, Gibbs. It's a pirate's life for me. Savvy?
Jack Sparrow!
We're devils and black sleep really bad eggs.
Damn! Jack Ssssparroooow!
You'll always remember this as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow. This is the day You'll alwaysremember this as the day that you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow.
What's your idea?
So you see, mercer, every man has a price he will willingly accept even for what he hoped never to sell. Savvy?
You are done, Jack.
This is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow.
What should I do?
If you were waiting for the opportune moment, that was it. Savvy?
What are you looking for?
Not all treasure is silver and gold, mate. I seek the sun of the sea.
Captain, I think the crew, meaning me as well, were expecting something a bit more... *shiny*. What with the Isla de Muerta going all pear shaped, reclaimed by the sea, and the treasure with it.
And the Royal Navy chasing us all around the Atlantic. Aye.
Lift the skin up! 
All on deck! Run! And keep running! Run as if the devil himself and itself is upon us! 
Do we have a heading?
Ah! Ooh! Run! Land.
Which port?
Didn't say port. I said land. Any land. Savvy.
Fire!
No? Up! No no!? Wait! No no! More wood! Big fire! Big! Fire! I am chief! Want big fire! Come on!
Fire is done.
Oh bugger. Little seasoning. Eh? Well done.
Ahhh! Fye-fye!
Well, go on! Go get them! Hay ala!
Hay ala! 
Ala, ala!
Cut it loose! Find a rock! Roll the cage! Lift the cage! Hurry!
Bugger.
Make ready to cast off!
Good doggie! Doggie? 
Jack Sparrow!
children! This is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost catch Captain Jack Sparrow.
