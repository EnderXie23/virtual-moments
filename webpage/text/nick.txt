Well, I stood up for you, and you lied to me. You liar!
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart. And I'm not the liar. He is.
All right, Slick-Nick. You're under arrest.
Really? For what?
Gee, I don't know. How about selling food without a permit? Transporting undeclared commerce accross borough lines? False advertising.
Permit. Receipt of declared commerce. And I didn't falsely advertize anything. Take care.
You told that mouse the Pawpsicle sticks were redwood!
That's right. Red wood. With a space in the middle. Wood that is red. You can't touch me, Carrots. I've been doing this since I was born.
You're gonna wanna refrain from calling me Carrots.
My bad. I just naturally assumed you came from some little carrot-choched Podunk. No? 
Oh, Nick. Night Howlers aren't wolves. They're toxic flowers. I think someone is targeting predators on purpose and making them go savage!
Wow... Isn't that interesting?
Wait... Wait! Listen... I know you'll never forgive me! And I don't blame you. I wouldn't forgive me either. I was ignorant. And irresponsible and small-minded. But predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes. I have to fix this. But I can't do it without you. And after we're done, you can hate me. And that will be fine. Because I was a horrible friend.
Don't worry, Carrots. I'll let you erase it in 48 hours. All right, get in here. Okay. Oh, you bunnies. You're so emotional. There we go. Deep breath. Are you just trying to steal the pen? Is that what this is? You're standing on my tail, though. Off, off, off, off...
Thank you. Never let them see that they get to you. 
So... Things do get to you?
No, I mean, not anymore. But I was small, any emotionally unbalanced like you once.
Har-har.
No, it's true.
I think I was 8, or maybe 9, and all I want to do was join the Junior Ranger Scouts.
And...
I learned two things that day. One, I was never gonna let anyone see that they got to me. 
And two?
If the world's only gonna see a fox as shifty and untrustworthy, there is no point in trying to ba anything alse.
Nick, you are so much more than that.
Boy, look at that traffic down there. How about we go out to Chuck in Traffic Central. Chuck, how are things looking on the Jam Cams?
Nick, I'm glad you told me.
The Jam Cams...
Seriously. It's okay.
No, no, no. There are traffic cameras everywhere! All over the canopy. Whatever happened to that jaguar...
The traffic cams would have caught it!
Bingo!
